# Chello

## Description

An alternative to Trello -- hence the working title -- where I plan on leaving in some core features, while also adding things I felt missing in Trello and other alternatives.

## Development

I am currently developing the backend with Nestjs and TypeScript, and for now I'm considering building the frontend in Angular. Since I started this project to learn more about building scalable projects using TypeScript, but not fully sure about the frontend yet.

## Contributing

I plan on eventually making this project open source, but for now I would like to first build an MVP.

## Techstack

- TypeScript
- NestJS
- Postgres
- Docker
- Angular (?)

## Resources

A List of resources I've found useful whilst building this project:

- A course I used to get a better understanding of TypeScript https://www.udemy.com/share/101WXkAkQTcF5bR34=/
- A course I used to learn about NestJS as a framework
